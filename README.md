# Assessing Racial Bias in Arrest and BookingPractices in Toronto: Insights and Implications from 2020-2021

## Overview

This research analyzes arrest and booking records from the Toronto Police Service for 2020 and 2021 to investigate racial disparities in policing. The data reveals that while Black and Indigenous individuals are overrepresented in arrests, booking rates following arrests were consistent across different ethnic groups. These results indicate that inequities may arise earlier in the policing process rather than during the booking stage. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing reforms to promote fairness and accountability in law enforcement practices.
