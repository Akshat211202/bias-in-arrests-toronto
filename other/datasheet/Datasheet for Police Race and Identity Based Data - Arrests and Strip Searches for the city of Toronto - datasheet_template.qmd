Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

**Motivation**

1.  *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset was created to investigate arrest patterns in Toronto, focusing on racial representation and potential disparities.
2.  *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    -   The dataset was likely compiled by researchers or academic institutions studying criminal justice or racial equity, potentially in collaboration with public entities.
3.  *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    -   The funding source is not explicitly stated.
4.  *Any other comments?*
    -   None

**Composition**

1.  *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
    -   Each instance represents an individual arrest event, with associated demographic, geographic, and legal attributes.
2.  *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
    -   The dataset contains thousands of arrest records (specific count to be derived from the full document).
3.  *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
    -   It is unclear if the dataset includes all arrests or represents a sample.
4.  *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
    -   Each instance includes details such as race, gender, arrest location, type of offense, and socioeconomic indicators of the area.
5.  *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   Yes, labels may include arrest outcomes, offense categories, or demographic classifications.
6.  *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
    -   Some records may have missing or incomplete demographic or arrest details.
7.  *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
    -   Relationships such as correlations between demographic variables and arrest outcomes may be implied but not explicitly documented.
8.  *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
    -   No specific splits are provided, but the dataset could be partitioned by time, geography, or demographics.
9.  *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   The dataset may contain biases or inconsistencies due to data collection methods.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
    -   The dataset is self-contained but may reference external demographic or geographic datasets for enrichment.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   No personally identifiable information is included; all data appears to be anonymized.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
    -   No, though the results could highlight sensitive systemic issues.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
    -   Yes, it identifies sub-populations by race, gender, and location.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
    -   No, all data appears to be anonymized.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
    -   Yes, data includes variables like race, gender, and arrest location.
16. *Any other comments?*
    -   None

**Collection process**

1.  *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
